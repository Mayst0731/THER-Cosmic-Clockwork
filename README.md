Here's what's living inside it:

Animated orrery — a mechanical solar system (Mercury → Mars) with glowing planets, orbital rings, golden tick-mark bezels, and a hoverable Earth with its own orbiting Moon
Live starfield — 320 twinkling stars with individual phase and speed
Pulsing spectral analyzer — 24 bands animating across the infrared-to-UV spectrum
Live readouts — solar flux, geomagnetic field strength, cosmic ray density, and observatory bearing all update every 2 seconds with randomized plausible values
Real clock — your actual time and date, top right
